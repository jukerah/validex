# Vkrun Community Contribution Guide

The purpose of this document is to create a contribution process that:

* Encourages new contributions.
* Encourages contributors to stay involved.
* Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.
* Creates a transparent decision-making process that makes it clear
  how contributors can be involved in decision-making.
* A **Contributor** is any individual who creates or comments on an
  issue or pull request.

## Logging Issues

Please log an issue for any concerns or problems you may have. In case
of doubt, log an issue and any additional policies on what to include
will be provided in the responses. The only exception is security
disclosures, which should be sent privately.

Vkrun maintainers or contributors may direct you to another repository
or ask for additional clarifications before the issue is resolved.

Please be courteous and respectful. It is expected that every
participant follows the project's Code of Conduct.

## Contributions

Any changes to the resources of this repository should be made through
a pull request. This applies to all changes to documentation, code,
binary files, etc.

 * No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should wait at least 72
hours to ensure that contributors in other time zones have time to
review. Weekends and other holiday periods should also be considered to
ensure that all active contributors have a reasonable amount of time to
engage in the discussion and review process, if they wish to do so.

In case of an objection being raised on a pull request, all involved
parties should reach a consensus addressing the concerns expressed in
the discussion, commit to the proposed change, or withdraw the proposed
change.
